/* ===========================================================================
 *  committed-flexible.js  -  Activity's distinctive lens: of the money that
 *  ARRIVED in a period, how much was already spoken for (committed) and how
 *  much was genuinely free to move (flexible), and how much of the free
 *  portion was actually spent.
 *
 *  This is the PAST-TENSE face of the same idea Overview shows in the present:
 *  it reuses the very same recurring detector the shared primitive exports
 *  (detectRecurring / twoWayKeys), so "committed" here can never drift from
 *  "commitments" there. Grounded in mental accounting - it names a split people
 *  already make in their heads (spoken-for money vs discretionary money).
 *
 *  PURE and Node-testable. No DOM, no fetch, no mutation.
 *
 *  DOUBLE-COUNT DISCIPLINE (the trap this module must avoid):
 *   - income is counted at the external credit, never the internal sweep.
 *   - discretionary CARD spend comes from the CARD ledger's spend rows; the
 *     bank-side card PAYMENT (an internal transfer to one's own card) is NOT
 *     counted, or the same money would appear twice.
 *   - committed = detected recurring standing debits only (insurance, loan,
 *     credit union). The card is NOT "committed" here, because card spend is
 *     itself the discretionary act being measured.
 *
 *  THE RECONCILING LINE (mental accounting's known failure mode):
 *  a "flexible" bucket must never be shown alone, or it reads as "safe to spend
 *  in full". So the model always carries a reconciling statement connecting
 *  flexible spending back to whether COMMITMENTS themselves moved this period.
