/* ===========================================================================
 *  goals.js  -  measurable goals, the three-state safety boundary, and the
 *  safe-contribution guard. Composes the PROVEN primitive and forecast; it
 *  invents no numbers of its own.
 *
 *  FROZEN CONTRACT (pruned goal model):
 *   - THREE measurable types, each checkable from data:
 *       'cushion'      keep a cash buffer of N days of typical outflow
 *       'clear-card'   clear the card balance by a date
 *       'spend-ceiling' hold spending under an amount over a repeating period
 *   - Each goal carries: a measurable target, a date or continuing threshold, a
 *     present value (MEASURED, not entered), one forecast consequence, and one
 *     OPTIONAL personal trigger the person explicitly saves.
 *
 *  THE SAFETY BOUNDARY - three explicit states, never a silent judgement:
 *     1. 'chosen'     a value the person set
 *     2. 'calculated' a saved formula: known commitments + a chosen cushion
 *     3. 'none'       nothing configured -> show the projected low point and
 *                     assert nothing about safe / unsafe
 *   The app may SUGGEST a starting boundary, but it is inert until reviewed and
 *   saved (returned as `suggestion`, never applied).
 *
 *  THE SAFE-CONTRIBUTION GUARD:
 *   A goal never recommends a contribution that would push the forecast low
 *   point below the safety boundary. Where the target and available cash
 *   conflict, it states the shortfall and offers a smaller amount OR a later
 *   date - it never silently proceeds, and never states the decision for the
 *   person.
 *
 *  PURE and Node-testable. No DOM, no fetch, no mutation. Records live in the
 *  v4 `goals` store (keyPath 'id').
 *
 * G (clear-card engine extension, formerly KNOWN DEFERRED WORK): resolved.
 * buildGoalModel's clear-card branch now detects a passed deadline and
 * states payoff feasibility (via the locally-ported projectCardPayoffLocal,
 * below) - a true superset of the old reporting.js's computeGoalProgress.
 * met stays byte-identical (balance <= 1), so threeStateMetForLog's log
 * protection is untouched. g_clearcard_proof.mjs is the standing gate;
 * goal_engine_parity_proof.mjs's PART 3 now asserts the gap is CLOSED,
 * not that it exists. Retiring clear-card's LIVE CARD off the old engine
 * (ahead-render.js's renderGoalCardOldEngine) is its own separate, staged
 * step - not folded into this edit, same discipline as every retirement
 * this session.
