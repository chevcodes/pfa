/*
 * ahead-render.js  -  the "Ahead" destination: Coming Up (Round 2) and Where
 * you're headed - goal-setting, the scenario tool, the monthly follow-up
 * (Round 4, plan section 6.2).
 *
 * The forecast switches on only once there is enough bank history to trust
 * it (state.cfg.ahead.minMonthsForForecast, default 2 months) and a readable
 * cash position exists. Below that, this shows a calm explanation of what is
 * missing and how close the person already is - never a shaky guess dressed
 * up as a real number, matching how every other "not enough yet" state in
 * this app already behaves (periodEmptyNotice, detectIncompleteMonth).
 *
 * Every Coming Up figure is read from data already stored - the current cash
 * position, the combined regular commitments (with their expected day), and
 * the recurring income pattern - never from day-to-day discretionary
 * spending, which this app does not attempt to predict.
 *
 * Where you're headed holds three things new to the app: a single stated
 * goal (GOAL_TYPES, reporting.js - a short fixed set the app can honestly
 * measure, never open text), a hands-on scenario tool that recomputes the
 * SAME runway figure Overview's own narrative already uses, and the monthly
 * honest follow-up - a frozen record app.js's checkMonthlyGoalIfDue already
 * builds each month, simply displayed here. Goal-setting itself is a plain
 * inline form (matching manage-data.js's "Your name" section), not a modal,
 * since it is a personal setting a person returns to and edits, not a
 * one-off per-row action.

  /* ===========================================================================
   * G (clear-card engine extension) completes the goal-system migration: the
   * live card's engine dispatch is now UNCONDITIONAL - every goal type
   * (cushion, spend-ceiling, clear-card) renders through renderGoalCardNewEngine.
   * The old engine (reporting.js's describeGoal/computeGoalProgress path) has
   * no remaining live-card caller in this file.
   *
   * How the last gap closed: buildGoalModel's clear-card branch previously had
   * no deadline-passed detection and no payoff-feasibility check, so its
   * wording was MISLEADING for clear-card specifically (e.g. "needs
   * $50,000/month" toward a deadline already passed; no signal of whether a
   * pace was ever actually hit). G added both (a locally-ported
   * projectCardPayoff, goals.js), proven as a true superset of the old engine
   * by g_clearcard_proof.mjs and goal_engine_parity_proof.mjs's PART 3 (now
   * asserting the gap is CLOSED, not that it exists). met stays byte-identical
   * throughout (balance <= 1), so threeStateMetForLog's monthly-log protection
   * is untouched by any of this.
   *
   * Dispatch is on the MIGRATED type, not the raw state.goal.type - GOAL_TYPES
   * still uses the old id 'runway' (reporting.js), so a goal set THIS session
   * via renderGoalForm() is still literally type:'runway' until the next
   * reload's boot-time migration runs. Checking the migrated type means a
   * freshly-set goal gets the new engine's reading immediately, not after a
   * reload.
