/* Electron preload - the only bridge between the shared UI and the desktop.
 *
 * Context isolation is on, so the renderer sees just this small, explicit API
 * and never Node itself. app-controller.js checks for window.ccDesktop to decide whether
 * folder features are available; on the phone that object is simply absent and
 * the identical code falls back to the Add-statement file picker.
 *
 * CommonJS (.cjs) on purpose: Electron's sandboxed preload scripts are only
 * reliably supported as CommonJS, so this stays paired with electron-main.cjs
 * even though the rest of the project uses ES modules. The .cjs extension
 * always parses as CommonJS in Node, independent of the project's
 * "type": "module" setting, so nothing here needed to change.
